## Electoral Fraud Monitoring System (People's Power)
### Problem Domain
Elections worldwide often suffer from various types of fraud and irregularities, which undermine public trust and the integrity of democratic processes. The Electoral Fraud Monitoring System (People's Power) aims to detect, monitor, and report electoral fraud in real-time using modern technologies like biometric verification, anomaly detection, and automated reporting systems.

## Overview
### The Electoral Fraud Monitoring System:

* Detects and prevents duplicate voting using biometric verification (fingerprint and facial recognition).
* Monitors voter activity, detects unusual patterns, and triggers alerts for suspicious behavior.
* Analyzes vote data using historical comparisons and risk metrics to generate fraud detection reports.
* Provides real-time reporting and alert mechanisms for electoral bodies to take immediate action.
